    <p>The "Klaw" as many NBA fans like to call him, has grew up loving basketball...and it shows. Unfortunately, I didn't start following his career untill he started playing with the Raptors from 2018 to 2019. However, now that he led the Raptors to victory, he holds a special place in my heart, and many other Canadians hearts as well. </p>
